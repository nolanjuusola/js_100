/*
4.
Does the following code produce an error?
Why or why not? What output does this code 
send to the console?

for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}
Having all three components of a for loop are optional, 
so omitting the incremental part from the loop isnt an issue. Also
i is being incremented inside the console.log, so the loop will work 
fine, and print 
1
2
3
4
5
